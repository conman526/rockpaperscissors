# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a very basic Odin project Javascript game. All scripting was done by me from scratch.

Goals for updating:
 - upgrade the way the data for round wins is stored in the array. Would like to move it to an object.
 - introduce a barebones UI for the game
 - upgrade barebones UI to an attractive UI
 - make attractive UI responsive
